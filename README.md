# CMDA4654 Project 2
- You must clearly explain the important concepts related to your topic, a bit of the lighter theory is expected within reason and/or explanation of the algorithm
- You should motivate when/why we would use a particular method
- You should use 1-2 baby examples (iris, mtcars, etc) to demonstrate how the method works
- In addition to a baby example, you are required to demonstrate your method on data that you must collect yourself from a research area that has been assigned to you
- The presentation should be a minimum of 27 slides
- You need to have a link to the data that you used in your examples in the slide where you introduce it.  You should host the data in a .csv file on Google Drive
- All plots should have elements that are clear and easy to see.  Every plot needs a title and properly labeled axes.  If a legend is appropriate it should be included
